    "## Web APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "An _application programming interface_ (API) is a collection of functions and data structures for communicating with other software. For instance, whenever you use a Python package, you're using the API created by the package's developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Websites sometimes provide an API so that programmers can access content without web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we call a function in a web API?"

    "### Hypertext Transfer Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is a set of rules for communicating over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, your web browser uses HTTP every time you visit a web page. The browser makes a _request_ to the server for the page, and if nothing goes wrong, the server _responds_ with the page. If you have Firefox or Chrome, you can inspect these requests with your browser's web developer tools (`Ctrl-I`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Several [different kinds of HTTP requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods) are possible. Think of these as the different \"verbs\" you can use when communicating in HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many protocols exist for communicating over the internet. For instance, you may have heard of _file transfer protocol_ (FTP) for transferring files, or _simple mail transfer protocol_ (SMTP) for sending/receiving email. However, web APIs almost always use HTTP."

    "### Representational State Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular kind of web API is a _representational state transfer_ (REST) API. In a REST API:\n",
    "   \n",
    "* Each function has a different URL, sometimes called an _endpoint_.\n",
    "* The server handles separate function calls independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) to answer our first example question. One of the endpoints in the Star Wars API is `https://swapi.co/api/`. This endpoint returns a list of all other endpoints in the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first use a web API, check the documentation to find out what the endpoints are and what kind of HTTP requests to use. If the documentation doesn't mention what kind of HTTP request to use, then GET is usually the right choice."

    "\n",
    "* _JavaScript Object Notation_ (JSON): JSON looks and works a lot like Python lists and dictionaries. Lists are surrounded with `[ ]`, and dictionaries are surrounded with `{ }`. There are many Python libraries for reading JSON into lists and dictionaries. Jupyter notebooks are an example of a file in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _eXtensible Markup Language_ (XML): XML uses \"tags\" denoted by `< >` to mark up sections of text. We'll learn more about XML when we learn about web scraping, since XML is very similar to hypertext markup language (HTML), the language used to build web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Star Wars API returns data in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
