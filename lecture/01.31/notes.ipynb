    "\n",
    "Endpoints in REST APIs work the same way, but the syntax is different. You can pass arguments by adding `?PARAMETER=ARGUMENT` to the end of the URL. Parameter and argument pairs are separated by `&`. This syntax is called a _query string_.\n",

    "\n",
    "The search endpoint is `https://itunes.apple.com/search`, and the documentation lists several parameters. We can use __requests__ to build the query string automatically."

    "For instance, The Guardian, a British newspaper, provides a [web API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/) to access their news articles. You need an API key to use their web APIs. You can get one for free [here](https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer).\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to keep your API key separate from your code:\n",

    "2. Use Python to load the API key into a variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "### OAuth\n",
    "\n",
    "[OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) is a way to give an application access to data on a website or web API.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might run into OAuth if you use a web API where the data is private. For instance, Twitter provides a [web API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html) for managing your personal Twitter account. If you want to access the API from a Python script, first you have to use OAuth to tell Twitter that the script has permission to use your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "OAuth can operate in several different ways. As always, check the documentation for the web API you want to use in order to find out what you need to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest case of OAuth requires scripts to have a key or token from the web API provider. This is very similar to using an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more complicated cases, the **requests-ouathlib** package (documentation [here](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) may help."

    "## Undocumented Web APIs\n",

    "* [Yolo County Health Inspections](https://yoloeco.envisionconnect.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can identify these websites by looking at requests in your browser's developer tools. In Firefox or Chrome, you can open the developer tools with `ctrl-shift-i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requests to web APIs almost always return JSON or XML data. By examining the browser requests, you can work out the endpoints and parameters, allowing you to use the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CAUTION:** Web APIs that are undocumented are often undocumented for a reason. Using an undocumented API may make someone angry or get you into legal trouble! Government and quasi-government websites (like the examples above) are probably okay, as long as you cache and rate-limit your requests. For everything else, find for an alternative or get permission first."
