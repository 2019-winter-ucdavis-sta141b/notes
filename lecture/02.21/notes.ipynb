    "## Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "A _database_ is a collection of data. There are several different models for how to organize data in a database; these are called _database models_. In this context, \"model\" refers to a design or mental model, not a statistical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _relational model_ organizes data as a collection of tables. Tables have rows (also called _tuples_ or _records_) and columns (also called _attributes_). Most tables have a _key_ column that is unique for each row and _relates_ the table to other tables. The relational model is the most popular database model by far, and the one we'll focus on in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many different software programs for managing databases, called _database management systems_ (DBMS). Each DBMS usually has its own format for storing data on disk, independent of the database model. Some popular DBMSes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)\n",
    "* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)\n",
    "* [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server)\n",
    "* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use a database? There are several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your data may already be in a database, so converting to another format is extra work.\n",
    "* Database operations are highly optimized, so they typically take less time and memory than an equivalent operation in Python.\n",
    "* Database operations can run on datasets that are too large to fit in memory. Doing this in Python requires special programming strategies.\n",
    "* Many DBMSes provide built-in version control, multi-user access, and security checks.\n",
    "* Databases can be updated in real time."
