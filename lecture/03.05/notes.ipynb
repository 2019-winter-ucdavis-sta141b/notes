    "To use this strategy, you'll need a Python package that can save animated images. Let's look at an example using the __imageio__ package to save a GIF image. We'll use the Gapminder Dataset, which contains statistics for countries from 1800 to 2015. This dataset is based on data from the [Gapminder Project](https://www.gapminder.org/)."
