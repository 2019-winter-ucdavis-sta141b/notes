    "\n",
    "Code sells are set up to run Python code. When you open a Jupyter notebook, Jupyter runs a Python session called a _kernel_ in the background. Each time you run a code cell, the code is sent to the kernel, and then the results are printed in the notebook. The kernel maintains state between cells, so code you run in one cell can affect code you run in another cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Caution!__ The state of the kernel depends on the order you run cells in, not the order cells appear in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can stop or restart the kernel using the `Kernel` menu. This is mostly useful when you want to cancel a computation.\n",
