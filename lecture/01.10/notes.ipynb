    "1. Clone a repo from a server (like GitHub) with `git clone`. This downloads remote -> local.\n",
    "2. Make some changes to your local copy of the repo.\n",

    "Let's learn the add, commit, and push commands.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you're done adding files, it's time to create the commit. Before you create the commit, optionally use `git status` to check that the changes you meant to add were added.\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything looks correct, use `git commit -m \"MESSAGE\"` to create a commit. Replace `MESSAGE` with a 1 sentence message explaining what's changed in the commit. The commit message is a reminder for you and anyone else using your repo, so make sure it's clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make as many commits as you want before pushing them back to the server. When you are ready to push them back to the server, make sure you are connected to the internet and then use `git push`.\n",
