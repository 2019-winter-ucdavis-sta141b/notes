# STA 141B Project Presentations

<!--
2 lectures * (80 min - 5 min) = 150 min
150 min / 37 groups ~= 4 min
-->

The project presentations will be in class on Tuesday __March 12__ and Thursday
__March 14__. Grading for groups that present on Thursday will be a little bit
stricter, since they have more time.

This page will be updated with a link to sign up for a presentation time slot
on __Feb 27 at 6pm__.

* Format:
    + 4 minutes to present and answer 1 audience question
    + All group members must present something
    + Any group members can answer the audience question

* Tell us three things:
    1. What's your project about? What are your goals or what questions does
       your project address?
    2. What specific tasks have you completed?
    3. What interesting results have you found?

This is an opportunity to get feedback, so you may want to focus on results
where you want feedback.

Asking questions at the end of someone's presentation is a good way to improve
your participation score.

## Peer Feedback

You must also give feedback on presentations from other groups for at least 1
day of presentations.

A link will be posted here soon to a git repo where you can submit your
feedback.

## Grading

Each presentation will be graded on three components:

* Preparedness
    + How prepared were you to present?
    + Are your slides well-designed?
    + Does it seem like you rehearsed?
* Motivation
    + How well did you summarize your project goals?
    + How well did you express the purpose or meaning of your project?
*   Results
    * How well did you summarize your results?
    * Are the results you presented clearly relevant to your goals?

Group members will also be individually graded (credit/no credit) for
submitting peer feedback.

## Presentation Skills

Plan to have about 4-6 slides, which means you will spend about 1 minute
talking about each slide. This might seem like a lot of time to spend on a
single slide, but is actually very little.

Rehearse as a group at least once before you present. Use a stopwatch to time
your rehearsal, to make sure your presentation is not too short or too long.
Remember to leave a little bit of time (~30 seconds) to take an audience
question.

Use rehearsal to give each other feedback. For each group member that speaks,
think about:

* Are they following the general advice for presentations (in the next
  section)?
* Are they speaking clearly?
* Are they being vague?
* Can you understand what they're talking about?
* What kinds of questions will the audience have for them?


### General Advice

Several things matter when you present...

* How you act:
    + Face the audience
    + Maintain good posture and don't cross your arms
    + Move your hands or even body while speaking
    + Speak at a deliberate pace (not too slow, not too fast)
    + Don't giggle or laugh unless someone told a joke
    + Be conversational. Don't read from your slides

* What you say:
    + Introduce yourselves and your project at the beginning
    + Avoid acronyms and abbreviations
    + Avoid assumptions about the audience: like, you know, as expected, ...
    + Avoid adverbs (words ending in "-ly"): very, easily, entirely, ...
    + Avoid pronouns without context: it, this
    + Think about what the "story" is for your project. What's interesting and
      important?
    * Thank the audience at the end!

* Slides
    + Don't make comparisons to previous slides
    + Support claims with evidence
    + Design visuals carefully (see the graphics checklist)
    + Make uncluttered slides (don't put too much on one slide)
    + Make self-contained slides
    + Use plain language
    + Check spelling, grammar, and formatting
    + Plan for at least 30 seconds (probably 1 minute) per slide


### Types of Slides

Most presentations really only have three kinds of slides:

* Title Slide
    + Include a title and your names
    + Don't forget to present this slide

* Story Slide
    + Make the title the message the audience should take away
    + Use 1-3 points on the slide to support the title

* Summary Slide
    + Summarize (quickly) the main points of your talk
    + Include miniature versions of key visuals
