# STA 141B Final Project

_Keep an eye on this page, it may be updated! Latest Update: Jan 31_

Description: You should work in a group of 3-4 people (no more than 4). The
purpose of the project is to provide you with real data science experience,
which includes:

* Posing questions
* Finding data sources
* Exploring and visualizing the data
* Working collaboratively with a team
* Presenting your findings through writing and speaking

## Getting Started

I recommend you get started by brainstorming project topics or themes that
interest your group. To narrow down your project to just one topic, think
about:

*   What questions does your topic address or what problems does your topic
    solve? Why and to whom are these meaningful?

*   What's challenging about your topic?

*   Are there credible, **public** datasets available to explore the topic?
    See below for some suggested data sources.

*   Is a 6-week project long enough to explore the topic reasonably well?

Make sure that everyone in the group agrees on the topic. You will need a
certain curiosity about your topic in order to stay motivated throughout the
quarter.

Once you've selected a project topic, you can start working on the project
proposal and the project itself.

As inspiration and an example of what can be done with public datasets, see [I
Quant NY][NY]. Sample projects from previous years:

* [Sample 1][s1]
* [Sample 2](https://palautatan.github.io/project141b/)

## Components

The final project has four components:

Name             | Due
------------     | ---
Proposal         | Feb 4
Presentation     | Week 10
Report           | Finals Week, TBA
Group Evaluation | Finals Week, TBA

### Proposal

Your group should submit a 1-2 page project proposal (1 per group) by
__February 4th__. Your proposal should address:

*   What's the topic of your project? What question(s) will you attempt to
    answer or what problems will you attempt to solve? Why and to whom are
    these meaningful?

*   What data source(s) will your team use? Briefly describe each data source
    and explain how you think you will use it. Provide a link for each data
    source. This is a check to make sure that there is actually data available
    for your topic. If you ultimately decide not to use some of the data
    sources, or find additional data sources later, that's okay.

*   What makes your project challenging? Consider that you will have about 6
    weeks to work on the project. What skills from STA 141A-B or other
    statistics classes do you expect to use on the project?

The proposal is your best opportunity to get feedback on your project. Make
sure it's clear and addresses the questions above. You can also use the
proposal to tell us about any other comments or concerns you have about your
project topic. You do not need to present any data analyses in the proposal.

The proposal will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory. Your priority should
be working on the project itself; don't spend more than a few hours working on
the proposal. Make sure all group members have read the proposal and agree on
what it says.

Submit your proposal in your project repository. Make sure it is labelled
clearly (it helps if you put a link in your `README.md`). The proposal should
be a Markdown File (`.md`) or Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).

### Presentation

Your group will give an approximately 5-minute in-class presentation in __week
10__. All group members will be required to speak. More information about the
presentations will be released in week 8.

### Report (grading criteria)

The final report is due in __finals week__. The report should be 8-10 pages
including writing and visualizations, but excluding code. 

We will score your report according to the class rubric:

*   Reporting: Are there clear research questions that you asked, and did you
    address these in an orderly fashion? Did you make well justified
    conclusions? Is your project easy to read?

*   Visualization: Do your visualizations follow best practices such as those
    outlined in the graphics checklist and described in the class references?
    Do your visualizations support your conclusions? 

*   Code: Is your code well-organized and easy to read? Is your code
    reproducible? Is your code documented? Is your code reasonably efficient?
    Did you use appropriate data structures and algorithms?

In addition, we will score your report on 5 characteristics, with the highest
scores going only to the best projects in the class:

*   Data Collection: How much work was necessary to get your data into memory,
    which includes web APIs, web scraping, and reading data from files. Was
    your data extracted from an online source? Did you use multiple data
    sources? Was your data in a difficult file format?

*   Data Cleaning and Storage: Did you process the data in an clear, efficient,
    and organized way? Do you join multiple data sources appropriately? Did you
    work with unstructured data? Did you store your processed data in an
    efficient way, using well-thought-out data structures or a database?

*   Exploratory Data Analysis: Did you explore the data before moving on with
    your analysis? Looking at the data can mean summary statistics, dealing
    with missing data, visualization, etc.

*   Statistics: Did you use statistics and machine learning? Was your use of
    statistics and machine learning valid? Did you choose appropriate methods
    based on your questions, the data, and your assumptions?

*   Interactive Visualization: Did you create any interactive visualizations?
    Do your interactive visualizations add insight to your project? Do they
    follow best practices for visualizations? Are they tailored to your
    specific topic and data (not generic or off-the-shelf)?

We will compute your project grade based on the rubric scores and your 3
highest-ranked characteristics. This way you are not necessarily required to do
well in all 5 characteristics.

We will be more generous when grading smaller groups. The material and effort
shown in your project should be roughly proportional to the number of people
in your group.


### Group Evaluation

Each group member is required to individually submit a 1-page evaluation of
their group. The group evaluation is due in __finals week__.

The group evaluation will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory. Your priority
should be working on the project itself; the group evaluation should only take
15-60 minutes of your time.

More details will be given soon.


## Potential Data Sources

The lecture will cover strategies to collect, clean, and combine data from a
variety of sources. You should be well-equipped to collect data from almost
anywhere.

The [The Awesome List of Public Datasets][awesome] has many potential data
sources to give you some ideas, but you should also look for other sources
online.

The United States' [data.gov][] is also a good source, but unfortunately shut
down along with the rest of the government.
